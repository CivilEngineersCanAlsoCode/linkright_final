# SYNC — MVP PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

---

# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Problem Definition

Early-to-mid career Product Managers (4–8 years experience) in India fail to secure interview opportunities due to weak, fragmented, and misaligned professional signal across resume and recruiter outreach.

### Current Baseline (Primary Persona)

- <1% shortlist rate
- 0–1 recruiter inbound per month
- <20 low-quality applications per month due to high manual effort
- No structured JD-alignment workflow

### MVP Target Transformation

- Enable generation of up to ~100 high-quality, JD-customized applications per month
- Sustain ≥5% shortlist rate (validation goal)
- Reduce customization effort to <15 minutes per application

This MVP focuses on proving that structured signal modeling + semantic retrieval + JD-aware resume optimization can measurably improve shortlist conversion.

---

## Core Value Proposition (MVP Scope)

Sync is a signal engineering system.

It converts raw experience into a structured, retrievable professional memory layer and activates it through JD-aligned resume optimization.

This MVP remains power-user oriented and Claude Code–orchestrated.

---

## North Star Metric (MVP)

Interview Conversion Rate = Interviews Secured / Applications Submitted

### Supporting Validation Metrics

- High-Quality JD-Customized Applications per Month (Target: up to 100)
- JD Alignment Score uplift ≥20%
- Time per Customized Application <15 minutes

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (MVP)

- No job aggregation
- No automated mass apply
- No recruiter marketplace
- No hosted SaaS deployment
- No advanced interview simulation

---

# 2. PRIMARY PERSONA — TITLE-MISMATCH PM

## Snapshot

- ~4 years experience
- ₹30 LPA
- Performs PM responsibilities without official PM title
- Aspires to FAANG-tier / global SaaS PM role

## Current Behavior

- <20 manual applications/month
- Resume manually edited each time
- Generic outreach messages
- Spreadsheet tracking

## Desired State After MVP Adoption

- Structured signal capture
- Semantic retrieval of relevant impact per JD
- Dedicated ResumeVersion per job
- Efficient JD customization workflow
- Clear shortlist tracking dashboard

---

# 3. MVP USER JOURNEYS

---

## JOURNEY 1 — Career Signal Capture + Indexing

### Trigger

User logs work reflections via UI.

### Flow

1. User pastes reflection.
2. Claude extracts structured signal (metrics, ownership, scope).
3. JSON validated and stored in MongoDB.
4. Reflection embedded and stored in Chroma vector DB.

### State Transition

Idle → Signal Stored → Signal Indexed

### Success Criteria

Signal retrievable via semantic query.

---

## JOURNEY 2 — JD-Based Resume Optimization (Core MVP Journey)

### Trigger

User pastes Job Description.

### Preconditions

- Base resume uploaded
- Signal entries exist

### Flow

1. Claude parses JD into structured schema.
2. JD embedded and queried against Chroma.
3. Top-k semantically relevant signal entries retrieved.
4. Resume loaded.
5. Claude generates optimization plan using:
   - JD schema
   - Retrieved signal entries
6. Bullets rewritten under constraints:
   - Must visually fit within a single rendered line
   - Layout validated after compilation
   - No fabricated metrics
7. Deterministic layout validation:
   - Detect line overflow
   - Detect >1 page (hard stop)
   - Auto-rewrite if needed
8. New ResumeVersion created in MongoDB.

### State Transition

Resume Draft → JD Parsed → Signal Retrieved → Rewritten → Layout Validated → ResumeVersion Stored

### Success Criteria

- PDF compiles to exactly one page
- Alignment score improves ≥20%

---

## JOURNEY 3 — Application Logging

### Trigger

User applies to a role.

### Flow

1. ResumeVersion selected.
2. ApplicationRecord created in MongoDB.
3. Status updated over time.

### Success Criteria

Shortlist rate measurable and attributable to ResumeVersion.

# 4. MVP MODULES

## 4.1 Career Signal Modeling Engine

Responsibilities:

- Extract structured signal
- Persist to MongoDB
- Generate embeddings
- Store in Chroma

Deterministic:

- Schema validation
- Embedding storage confirmation

---

## 4.2 Chroma Retrieval Engine (New MVP Component)

Infrastructure:

- Chroma vector DB running via Docker
- Accessed through Docker MCP from Claude Code CLI

Responsibilities:

- Store embeddings
- Retrieve top-k relevant signal entries per JD

Purpose:
Improve precision of resume rewriting by grounding Claude in relevant experience.

---

## 4.3 JD Parsing Engine

Model: Claude (via Claude Code CLI)

Outputs structured requirement schema.

---

## 4.4 Resume Optimization Engine

Model: Claude (primary reasoning engine)

Inputs:

- JD schema
- Retrieved signal entries
- Base resume

Validation Layer:

- Render-width enforcement
- Line overflow detection
- One-page enforcement
- Auto-iteration loop

---

## 4.5 ResumeVersion Manager

Each JD → one immutable ResumeVersion.
Stored in MongoDB with metadata.

---

## 4.6 Application Tracker

Tracks linkage between:

- JD
- ResumeVersion
- Outcome

Outputs shortlist rate.

---

# 5. DATA ARCHITECTURE (MVP)

## MongoDB (Source of Truth)

**Why Mongo?** Professional signals are highly varied across personas; a schema-less document store ensures we don't lose signal nuance.
Collections:

1. **users**: Profiles and persona definitions (e.g., Tech PM, Growth PM).
2. **career_signals**: Granular signal blocks extracted from sources (Obsidian, Resume).
3. **jd_profiles**: Structured targets parsed from JDs.
4. **resume_versions**: Immutable snapshots of optimized resumes (Data + Style).
5. **success_ledger**: Feedback loop records (Application Status, Interview Success).

## Chroma (Semantic Layer)

Stores embeddings for rapid top-k retrieval based on JD semantic intent.

---

# 6. ORCHESTRATION MODEL (MVP)

Primary Orchestrator:
Claude Code CLI / BMAD Sync Orchestrator

Tooling:

- MongoDB (via Connection String or Local instance)
- Chroma (via Local Persistent Storage)
- Local HTML/CSS render + validation scripts (Manual Browser Print to PDF)

---

# 7. REFINED AGENT ROLES (BMAD Granular)

1. **Parser**: Extracts structured raw data from resumes, Obsidian, and JDs.
2. **Scout**: Fetches company branding, colors, and industry-specific context.
3. **Inquisitor**: Conducts "Hidden Experience" interviews to fill JD-specific skill gaps.
4. **Linker**: Maps JD requirements to the most relevant user signals.
5. **Refiner**: Sculpts bullets, summaries, and skills based on Persona and JD intent.
6. **Sizer**: Enforces horizontal/vertical budget and one-page constraints.
7. **Styler**: Manages HTML/CSS templates and company-theming logic.
8. **Tracker**: Manages the Success Ledger and application lifecycle.

Cost Target:
Zero additional API cost beyond Claude access.

- Chroma runs in local Docker container

---

# 8. METRICS (MVP VALIDATION)

# MVP EXECUTION SUMMARY

This MVP integrates Chroma as a lightweight semantic retrieval layer via Docker MCP while keeping MongoDB as the structured source of truth and Claude Code CLI as the orchestrator.
